                        According to Newton's theory of universal gravitation the denser areas of these nebulae tend to
                        become even denser in a way that resembles an avalanche. <br>
                        The more matter they gather around them, the bigger mass they get and the bigger mass they get,
                        the more they attract matter around them. <br>
                        This gravitational collapse of a nebula forces matter to very high pressure, speed and
                        temperature. <br> Thus, in an extremely dense area, a protostar is formed. </p>

                                        <p class="desc"> A protostar mainly consists of Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He). <br>
                                            Due to its gravitational collapse, the gravitational potential energy is
                                            converted to heat.
                                            So when the temperature in the star reaches 1,000,000 °C (18,000,032 °F)
                                            thermonuclear fusion of Hydrogen to Helium can take place,
                                            producing huge amounts of energy.Every second, the amount of energy produced
                                            equals hundreds of billions of nuclear explosions.
                                            This procedure lasts for the biggest part of the life of the star and we say
                                            in astrophysics that the star is in "the main sequence".<br>
                                            Our sun is in that phase of its life. 
                                            The size and temperature of a main sequence star are determined by its mass, with more massive stars being hotter and larger 
                                            than less massive stars. The luminosity of a main sequence star is also proportional to its mass, with more massive stars being
                                            more luminous.</p> </span>

                                Therefore, it is shrinked and heated while its external parts start to
                                expand again.
                                <br>At some point, an instability is created between the different parts of
                                the star which results in a complete loss of its outer parts.
                                In its interior, no thermonuclear reactions take place anymore and the
                                pressure required to balance the gravity comes from

                                            the star becomes a "<strong><i>Red Supergiant</strong></i>",
                                            and its core is heated enough for the next cycle of thermonuclear reactions
                                            to occur. <br>
                                            <strong>Sometimes though, something very impressive happens.</strong><br>
                                            When the time comes for the thermonuclear fusion of iron into heavier
                                            elements to happen, a big inversion occurs.
                                            Because iron fusion is an endothermic reaction and so it absorbs energy,
                                            instead of releasing, when iron fusion is about to start, the core gets
                                            cooler instead of getting hotter.
                                            The pressure is reduced, and gravity begins to dominate again. The core is
                                            compressed and shrinked beyond measure,
                                            the pressure of electrons collapses against the vast gravitational power and
                                            electrons are forced to merge into protons, creating neutrons.
                                            <br>Now, the core almost exclusively consists of neutrons, touching one
                                            another, like a giant atomic nucleus.
                                            This stellar core is impossible to contract further.
                                            The vast gravitational power, which tries to crash the star, is reflected in
                                            this overdense core, leading to a phantasmagorical explosion
                                            named "<strong><i>Supernova</strong></i>",ejecting the content of the star

                                Neutron stars are extremely dense, with a mass similar to that of the Sun but a radius of only about 10 kilometers. <br>
                                They have extremely strong magnetic fields and rotate rapidly, with some neutron stars completing hundreds of rotations per second.

                                    <p class="desc">Supermassive Black Holesare classically defined as
                                        black holes with a mass above 100,000 solar masses. <br>
                                        The solar mass (M☉) is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, equal to
                                        approximately 2 * 10<sup>30</sup> kg.
                                        Some Supermassive black holes have masses of several billion solar masses.
                                        <br>
                                        Studies have suggested that the maximum natural mass that a black hole can
                                        reach, while being luminous accretors (featuring an accretion disk),
                                        is typically of the order of about 50 billion M☉ 
                                        Supermassive black holes,are much larger and more massive than their stellar counterparts. 
                                        They are typically found at the centers of galaxies and can have masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun. 
                                        It is currently believed that supermassive black holes are formed through the merging of smaller black holes 
                                        or through the direct collapse of large amounts of gas and dust in the early universe.<br>
                                        In addition to their size and mass, supermassive black holes also have a much greater impact on the structure 
                                        and evolution of galaxies than regular black holes. They can influence the motion of stars and gas in their vicinity 
                                        and play a key role in shaping the overall structure of the galaxy. <br>Some supermassive black holes are also observed
                                        to be actively accreting matter from their surroundings, producing intense radiation and powerful jets of particles that can be observed
                                        across vast distances.</p>
